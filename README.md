The BlurryControls library is meant to give your application a blurry look as it is known from the _AeroGlass_ design.

**_Meant to be used on Windows 10 exclusively_**
Feel free to have a look at the [BlurryControls/Wiki](https://github.com/ConfusedHorse/BlurryControls/wiki) for further information and usage suggestions or just clone and run the example application. :)
